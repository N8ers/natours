/* The 0% is where we start
100% is where we end - we can also have anything inbetween!
why transform: translateX()? 
because we want it coming in on the X axis and Left to Right

ALSO - look at class heading-primary-main & heading-primary-sub
we need to assign it the animation-name and animation-duration!
these are the only two properties NESSESSARY 
for an animation to work - but there are lots of others!

notice a shake at the end of an animation? check out 
   backface-visibility: hidden; under .heading-primary
   it determins of the back side of the element is visible 
   it comes in handy for rotating animations
