what I will learn in this lesson

-best ways to perform basic reset using universal selector
using the universal selector (*) you can add margin and padding
see more in the css file around line 10
the box-size property being border-box; it changes box model so border and padding are not added to total width or height - so they go away!
line height "vh" - at every point the height of the box should be the vh% of what is seen... i think the height is 95% of the view port height in the headers changes
background size cover - tries to fill the whole space that it covers

how to set project-wide fonr definitions

how to clip parts of elements using clip-path

*** A note on inline, block, and inline-block

inline elements: 
-respect L&R margins/padding but NOT top and btm
-CANNOT have a width and height set
-allow elements to sit on L&R 

block elements:
-respect above
-forces a line break after the block elements
-aquires full-width UNLESS the width is defined

inline-block elements:
-allow other elements to sit L&R 
-respects top & btm margin/padding
-respects height and width

*** A note on z-index
z-index relates when stacked/overlapping eachother
by defult the element that comes last in markup covers the previous
by giving a larger z-index to one property it will cover those with lower z-indexs
IF a child element has a z-index is is only relative to the parent element
and cannot overlap an element outside of the parent with a higher z-index

z-index only works with elements that have a position 
(either relative absolute or fixed)

***THREE PILLARS of WRITTING GOOD HTML & CSS***
I. Responsive Design
a website that works well across all devices and screen sizes
II. Maintainable & Scalable Code
III. Web Performance

What happens to CSS when we load up a page?
Loads HTML -> Parses HTML -> DOM
                          -> Load CSS -> Parse CSS (cascade & CSS values) -> css object model (CSSOM)
DOM & CSSOM -> render tree -> website rendering -> final rendered website

How CSS is Parsed 

quick termnology review: 

selector          ->      .my-class {
decloration block ->           
declaration       ->      propery: declared value;
                          }

Cascade - process of combining different stylesheets and resolving conflicts
between different CSS rules and declarations, when more than one rules
applies to a certain element.

SPECIFICITY;
1) Inline styles (in html)         
2) IDs 
3) classes/pseudo-classes, attributes       
4) elements, psudo-elements
Same level of specificty? -the last one wins!
universal selector * has no specificity value - so anything after takes precedent

How CSS Calues are prossed
rem px % vw
1) declared value - author declorations
2) cascaed value - after cascade
3) specified value - defaulting fi no cascaed value
4) computed value - calculated relative calues to absolute
5) used value - final calculations based on layout
6) actual value - browser and device restrictions

How units are converted from relative to absolute (px)
% (fonts) - if 150% that means it'll be 150% of the parent element 
% (lengths) - x% of parents computed width

em (fonts) - x * parent (computed font-size)
em (lengths) - x * current element (computed font-size)
rem - 'root em' uses the ROOT font size (x * root = computed font-size)

vh - 1vh = 1% of viewport height
vw - 1vw = 1% of viewport width

inheritance; a way of propogating property values from parents to children
every CSS property must have a value 

converting px to rem;
why use rem instead of px?
