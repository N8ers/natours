what I will learn in this lesson

-best ways to perform basic reset using universal selector
using the universal selector (*) you can add margin and padding
see more in the css file around line 10
the box-size property being border-box; it changes box model so border and padding are not added to total width or height - so they go away!
line height "vh" - at every point the height of the box should be the vh% of what is seen... i think the height is 95% of the view port height in the headers changes
background size cover - tries to fill the whole space that it covers

how to set project-wide fonr definitions

how to clip parts of elements using clip-path

*** A note on inline, block, and inline-block

inline elements: 
-respect L&R margins/padding but NOT top and btm
-CANNOT have a width and height set
-allow elements to sit on L&R 

block elements:
-respect above
-forces a line break after the block elements
-aquires full-width UNLESS the width is defined

inline-block elements:
-allow other elements to sit L&R 
-respects top & btm margin/padding
-respects height and width

*** A note on z-index
z-index relates when stacked/overlapping eachother
by defult the element that comes last in markup covers the previous
by giving a larger z-index to one property it will cover those with lower z-indexs
IF a child element has a z-index is is only relative to the parent element
and cannot overlap an element outside of the parent with a higher z-index

z-index only works with elements that have a position 
(either relative absolute or fixed)
